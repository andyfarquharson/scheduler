# Interview Scheduler
This is a single page app that allows students to book, edit, and cancel interview appointments.  This app was built with React and relies on an API server combined with a local PostgreSQL database.  Interviewer Scheduler also comes with a suite of tests courtesy of Jest and Cypress.
